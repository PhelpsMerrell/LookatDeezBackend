# üîç CosmosDB Logging Enhancement Summary

## What Was Added

### **CosmosService Logging:**
‚úÖ **Initialization logging** - Shows connection string, database name, container setup
‚úÖ **CreatePlaylistAsync** - Tracks playlist creation with ID, title, owner, and permission setup
‚úÖ **GetPlaylistByIdAsync** - Shows query execution, results count, found/not found status
‚úÖ **GetUserPlaylistsAsync** - Logs owned playlist retrieval with counts
‚úÖ **GetSharedPlaylistsAsync** - Detailed permission lookup and playlist filtering
‚úÖ **UpdatePlaylistAsync** - Playlist update operations with item counts
‚úÖ **Error handling** - CosmosException and general exceptions with status codes

### **UserRepository Logging:**
‚úÖ **Initialization logging** - Database and container setup
‚úÖ **CreateUserAsync** - User creation with ID, email, display name
‚úÖ **Error handling** - Conflict detection, CosmosDB errors, general exceptions

### **Dependency Injection Updates:**
‚úÖ **CosmosService** - Now receives ILogger<CosmosService> 
‚úÖ **UserRepository** - Now receives ILogger<UserRepository>
‚úÖ **Program.cs** - Updated DI registration to inject loggers

## üìã What You'll Now See in Logs

### **Successful Playlist Creation:**
```
=== CosmosService Initialization ===
Connection String: AccountEndpoint=https://localhost:8081/...
Database Name: lookatdeez-db
CosmosDB containers initialized: playlists, permissions

=== CreatePlaylistAsync ===
Creating playlist - ID: abc123, Title: "My Playlist", Owner: user-456
Attempting to create playlist in container with partition key: user-456
Playlist created successfully in CosmosDB - ID: abc123
Creating owner permission - PlaylistId: abc123, UserId: user-456
Owner permission created successfully
CreatePlaylistAsync completed successfully for playlist: abc123
```

### **User Creation:**
```
=== CreateUserAsync ===
Creating user - ID: user-456, Email: test@example.com, DisplayName: Test User
User created successfully - ID: user-456, Email: test@example.com
```

### **Playlist Retrieval:**
```
=== GetUserPlaylistsAsync ===
Getting playlists owned by user: user-456
Retrieved 2 playlists for user user-456
Total owned playlists for user user-456: 2

=== GetSharedPlaylistsAsync ===
Getting playlists shared with user: user-456
Found 1 permissions for user user-456
User user-456 has permissions for 1 playlists
Fetching playlist details for shared playlist: playlist-789
Adding shared playlist: playlist-789 (owned by user-123)
Total shared playlists for user user-456: 1
```

### **Error Scenarios:**
```
‚ùå CosmosDB error creating playlist - StatusCode: NotFound, Message: Resource not found, PlaylistId: abc123
‚ùå User already exists - ID: user-456, Email: test@example.com
‚ùå Playlist not found with ID: nonexistent-id
```

## üöÄ How to Monitor Your Issues

### **1. Container Missing Errors:**
Look for logs like:
```
CosmosDB error - StatusCode: NotFound, Message: Resource not found
```
This indicates containers don't exist. Run `create_containers.bat`

### **2. User Creation Problems:**
```
=== CreateUserAsync ===
Creating user - ID: <empty>, Email: <empty>, DisplayName: User
‚ùå CosmosDB error creating user - StatusCode: BadRequest
```
This shows JWT token isn't providing user info properly.

### **3. Playlist Creation Failures:**
```
=== CreatePlaylistAsync ===
Creating playlist - ID: abc123, Title: "Test", Owner: <null>
‚ùå CosmosDB error creating playlist - StatusCode: BadRequest
```
This shows user ID extraction is failing.

### **4. Permission Issues:**
```
Found 0 permissions for user user-456
User user-456 has permissions for 0 playlists
```
This shows permission records aren't being created.

## üîß Debugging Steps

### **Step 1: Check Container Creation**
1. Look for initialization logs:
   ```
   CosmosDB containers initialized: playlists, permissions
   ```
2. If missing, run: `create_containers.bat`

### **Step 2: Verify User Creation**
1. Look for user creation logs with valid data:
   ```
   Creating user - ID: <valid-guid>, Email: <real-email>
   ```
2. If ID is empty/null, JWT token extraction is failing

### **Step 3: Check Playlist Creation**
1. Look for playlist creation with valid owner:
   ```
   Creating playlist - Owner: <valid-user-id>
   ```
2. If owner is null, context.GetUserId() is failing

### **Step 4: Monitor Permission Creation**
1. Look for permission creation after playlist creation:
   ```
   Creating owner permission - PlaylistId: abc123, UserId: user-456
   Owner permission created successfully
   ```

## üéØ Key Log Patterns to Watch

### **‚úÖ Success Pattern:**
```
=== JWT Middleware Processing CreatePlaylist ===
JWT validation succeeded
Extracted user ID from JWT: <valid-id>
=== CreatePlaylistAsync ===
Playlist created successfully in CosmosDB
Owner permission created successfully
```

### **‚ùå Failure Pattern:**
```
=== JWT Middleware Processing CreatePlaylist ===
JWT validation failed
// OR
No user ID found in JWT token
// OR
=== CreatePlaylistAsync ===
CosmosDB error creating playlist - StatusCode: NotFound
```

## üö® Most Likely Issues to Look For

1. **Missing CosmosDB containers** - Look for "Resource not found" errors
2. **JWT token validation failing** - Look for "JWT validation failed" 
3. **User ID extraction failing** - Look for "No user ID found" or null/empty user IDs
4. **Container connection issues** - Look for connection string errors in initialization

## üìù Log Levels

- **Information**: Normal operations, successful completions
- **Warning**: Unexpected but non-fatal conditions (playlist not found, user conflicts)
- **Error**: Failures that prevent operations (CosmosDB errors, exceptions)

Your logs will now be **much more detailed** and help pinpoint exactly where things are failing! üéâ

## üß™ Testing Your Logging

1. **Start your backend** with the new logging
2. **Watch the console output** for the detailed logs
3. **Try creating a playlist** and watch the complete flow
4. **Check for any error patterns** mentioned above

The logs will now tell you **exactly** what's happening at each step of the CosmosDB operations!
